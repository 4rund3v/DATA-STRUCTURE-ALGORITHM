Problem Statement:
    Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets(the power set).
    The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3]
    Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
Example 2:
    Input: nums = [0]
    Output: [[],[0]]
    
Approach:
    We'll use a backtracking approach to generate all subsets.
    1. Start with an empty subset.
    2. For each element, we have two choices: include it in the current subset or not.
    3. Recursively generate subsets for the remaining elements.
    4. Add each generated subset to the result.

Time Complexity: O(2^n), where n is the number of elements in nums.
We have two choices (include or not) for each element, leading to 2^n subsets.

Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in nums.
This accounts for the recursion stack. The space to store all subsets is not counted as auxiliary space.
    
Key Points:
    1. Every subset is valid, including the empty set and the full set.
    2. The order of elements in each subset doesn't matter, but we maintain a specific order to avoid duplicates.
    3. We add each subset to the result immediately, before making recursive calls.
    4. Backtracking ensures we explore all possibilities efficiently.

       /     \        |
