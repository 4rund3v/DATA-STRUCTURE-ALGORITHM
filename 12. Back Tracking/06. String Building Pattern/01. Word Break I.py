Problem Statement:
    Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

    The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells 
    are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

    Space Complexity: O(L), where L is the length of the word
    Time Complexity: O(M * N * 3^L), where M and N are the dimensions of the board

Explanation:
    - Space Complexity is O(L) due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, we might 
      have to go L levels deep in the recursion.
    - Time Complexity: 
        * From every cell, we explore in 3 directions (avoiding the direction we came from).
        * This exploration can go for a maximum of L steps (word length).
        * So each exploration thread can go 3^L ways in the worst case.
        * We start this exploration from each cell of the M x N board.
        * Therefore, the total time complexity is O(M * N * 3^L).

Examples:

1. Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
   Output: true

2. Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
   Output: true

3. Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
   Output: false
