Problem Statement: Combination Sum IV

Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
    Output: 7
    Explanation:
        The possible combination ways are:
        (1, 1, 1, 1)
        (1, 1, 2)
        (1, 2, 1)
        (1, 3)
        (2, 1, 1)
        (2, 2)
        (3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Example 2:
    Input: nums = [9], target = 3
    Output: 0

Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 200
    1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    All the elements of nums are unique.
    1 <= target <= 1000

Visualization of the backtracking process for nums = [1,2,3], target = 4:

                       4
            /          |          \
           3           2           1
        /  |  \      / |  \      / |  \
       2   1   0    1  0  -1    0  -1 -2
     / | \  | \    | \
    1  0 -1 0 -1   0 -1
   /|\
  0-1-2

Each node represents the remaining target after choosing a number.
Paths ending with 0 are valid combinations.
Paths ending with negative numbers are pruned.

The valid paths are:
1. 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0  (1,1,1,1)
2. 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0      (1,1,2)
3. 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0      (1,2,1)
4. 4 -> 1 -> 0           (1,3)
5. 4 -> 2 -> 2 -> 0      (2,2)
6. 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0      (2,1,1)
7. 4 -> 1 -> 0           (3,1)

Note: This implementation uses backtracking, which is not the most efficient approach for this problem.
A dynamic programming solution would be more suitable for larger inputs.

"""
Approach:
We'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.
    1. Create a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of ways to form sum i.
    2. Initialize dp[0] = 1 (there's one way to form sum 0: by choosing nothing).
    3. Iterate from 1 to target, and for each sum i:
        - For each number in nums, if it's less than or equal to i, add dp[i - num] to dp[i].
    4. Return dp[target] as the final answer.

Time Complexity: O(target * len(nums))
Space Complexity: O(target)

Visual representation of the DP process for nums = [1,2,3], target = 4:

    dp[0] = 1 (base case)
    dp[1] = dp[0] = 1  (using 1)
    dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2  (using 1 and 2)
    dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] + dp[0] = 4  (using 1, 2, and 3)
    dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] + dp[1] = 7  (final answer)

This shows how we build up the solution for larger sums using the solutions for smaller sums.
