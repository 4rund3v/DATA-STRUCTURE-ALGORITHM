Problem Statement: Unique Path III
    Find the number of unique paths that visit every empty cell exactly once.
    Given a m x n grid, where:
        - 0 represents empty cells that can be walked through
        - 1 represents the starting point
        - 2 represents the ending point
        - -1 represents obstacles
    Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting point to the ending point, 
    that walk over every empty cell exactly once.

Args:
    grid (List[List[int]]): The m x n grid representing the maze.

Returns:
    int: The number of unique paths that visit every empty cell exactly once.

Time Complexity: O(3^(m*n)), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid.
    - In the worst case, we explore 3 new directions for each cell (excluding the direction we came from).
    - The depth of the recursion can go up to m*n in the worst case.

Space Complexity: O(m*n)
    - This is due to the recursion stack in the worst case scenario.

Example:
    Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
        1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
        2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)
