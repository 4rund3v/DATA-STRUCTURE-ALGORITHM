Problem Statement:
    Given an array of distinct positive integers (candidates) and a target integer,
    find all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to the target.
    Each number in candidates may be used an unlimited number of times.

Time Complexity: O(N^(T/M)), where N is the number of candidates,
    T is the target value, and M is the minimum value among the candidates.
    - In the worst case, we explore all possible combinations.
    - The maximum depth of recursion is T/M (using the smallest candidate repeatedly).
    - At each level, we have up to N choices.

Space Complexity: O(T/M)
    - The main space usage comes from the recursion stack.
    - The maximum depth of recursion is T/M.
    - Each recursive call stores a constant amount of data.

Example:
    Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
    Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
    Explanation:
    2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
    7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
    These are the only two combinations.

Visual Representation of the Decision Tree:
For candidates [2,3,6,7] and target 7, the decision tree would look like this:

                       []
              /     /     \     \
            [2]    [3]    [6]   [7]
           /  \     |
        [2,2] [2,3] [3,3]
        /     |
    [2,2,2] [2,3,2]
      |       |
  [2,2,2,2] [2,3,2]  (stop here as sum > 7)

    Valid combinations: [2,2,3] and [7]
