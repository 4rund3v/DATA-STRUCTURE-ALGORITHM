"""
Find the maximum amount of gold you can collect from the grid.

Problem Statement:
    In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing
    the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty. Return the maximum amount of gold
    you can collect under the following conditions:
        - Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
        - From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
        - You can't visit the same cell more than once.
        - Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
        - You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.


Returns:
    int: The maximum amount of gold that can be collected.

Time Complexity: O(4^k), where k is the number of cells with gold.
    - In the worst case, we explore 4 directions for each cell with gold.

Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of cells with gold.
    - This is due to the recursion stack in the worst case.

Example:
    Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
    Output: 24
    Explanation: Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
