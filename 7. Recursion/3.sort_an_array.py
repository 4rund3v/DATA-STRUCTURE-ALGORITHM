# Let's break down this recursive sorting solution:

# The main function merge_sort:
    # Base case: If the array has 1 or fewer elements, it's already sorted, so we return it.
    # Recursive case:
        # We divide the array into two halves.
        # We recursively call merge_sort on both halves.
        # We merge the sorted halves using the merge function.

# Time complexity: O(n log n) in all cases
# Space complexity: O(n) for the temporary arrays in the merge step


def merge_sort(arr):
    # Base case: if the array has 1 or fewer elements, it's already sorted
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    # Divide the array into two halves
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = arr[:mid]
    right_half = arr[mid:]
    
    # Recursively sort both halves
    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)
    
    # Merge the sorted halves
    return merge(left_half, right_half)


# The merge function:
    # This function takes two sorted arrays and merges them into a single sorted array.
    # It compares elements from both arrays and adds the smaller one to the result.
    # After one array is exhausted, it adds any remaining elements from the other array.
def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    left_index, right_index = 0, 0
    
    # Compare elements from both lists and add the smaller one to the result
    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):
        if left[left_index] <= right[right_index]:
            result.append(left[left_index])
            left_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[right_index])
            right_index += 1
    
    # Add any remaining elements
    result.extend(left[left_index:])
    result.extend(right[right_index:])
    
    return result
