Problem: Course Schedule

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1.
You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you
must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Solution Approach:
This solution uses Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting to check for cycles in the course
dependencies. If a cycle exists, it's impossible to finish all courses.

Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of courses and E is the number of prerequisites.
Space Complexity: O(V + E) for the adjacency list and queue.
