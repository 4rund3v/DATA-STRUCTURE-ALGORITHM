Problem Statement:
Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. 
If there is no clear path, return -1.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., (0, 0)) to the 
bottom-right cell (i.e., (n - 1, n - 1)) such that:
- All the visited cells of the path are 0.
- All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different 
  and they share an edge or a corner).

The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.

Time Complexity: O(n^2 * log(n^2)), where n is the side length of the matrix. 
The priority queue operations take log(n^2) time, and we might process each cell.

Space Complexity: O(n^2) for the priority queue and the result matrix.

Constraints:
- n == grid.length == grid[i].length
- 1 <= n <= 100
- grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
