Problem: Detect Cycle in Undirected Graph using BFS

Given an undirected graph, detect if there is a cycle in the graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
This implementation uses a queue of pairs to keep track of both the current node and its parent.

Function Signatures:
def create_graph(V: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]
def isCycleBFS(adj: List[List[int]], u: int, visited: List[bool]) -> bool
def isCycle(V: int, adj: List[List[int]]) -> bool

Where:
V: number of vertices
edges: list of edges, where each edge is represented as [u, v]
adj: adjacency list representation of the graph

Returns:
bool: True if a cycle is detected, False otherwise

Constraints:
1 ≤ V, E ≤ 10^4

Explanation:

1. create_graph function remains the same as before.

2. isCycleBFS function implements the BFS-based cycle detection:
   - It uses a queue of (node, parent) pairs.
   - It marks the starting node as visited and adds it to the queue with a parent of -1.
   - For each node, it checks all its neighbors:
     - If a neighbor is not visited, it's marked as visited and added to the queue.
     - If a neighbor is visited and not the parent, a cycle is detected.

3. isCycle function:
   - Initializes the visited array.
   - Calls isCycleBFS for each unvisited vertex (to handle disconnected components).
   - Returns True if a cycle is detected in any component, False otherwise.

4. print_graph and test_cycle_detection functions remain similar to before.

Key points of this BFS-based cycle detection:
- We use a queue of (node, parent) pairs to keep track of the BFS traversal and parent information.
- A cycle is detected if we encounter an already visited vertex that is not the parent of the current vertex.

Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
Space Complexity: O(V) for the queue and visited array.

This implementation closely follows the structure of the C++ code provided in the image,
adapted to Python syntax and conventions.
