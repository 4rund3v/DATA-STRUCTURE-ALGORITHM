Problem: Detect Cycle in Directed Graph using Kahn's Algorithm

Given a directed graph, detect if there is a cycle in the graph using Kahn's Algorithm.

Function Signatures:
    def create_graph(V: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]
    def has_cycle_kahns(V: int, adj: List[List[int]]) -> bool

Where:
    V: number of vertices
    edges: list of edges, where each edge is represented as [u, v]
    adj: adjacency list representation of the graph

Returns:
    True if a cycle is detected, False otherwise

Constraints:    1 ≤ V, E ≤ 10^4

Explanation:

1. Graph Creation:
   - The create_graph function builds an adjacency list representation of the directed graph.

2. Cycle Detection using Kahn's Algorithm:
   - Calculate in-degree for each vertex.
   - Initialize a queue with vertices having 0 in-degree.
   - Process vertices from the queue, reducing in-degrees of their neighbors.
   - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
   - Keep track of the number of vertices processed.
   - If the number of processed vertices is less than the total number of vertices, a cycle exists.

Key points of Kahn's algorithm for cycle detection:
- It's based on the principle of topological sorting.
- A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) can be fully processed by this algorithm.
- If there's a cycle, some vertices will never have their in-degree reduced to 0.

Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
Space Complexity: O(V) for the in-degree array and the queue.

This implementation correctly detects cycles in directed graphs using Kahn's algorithm.
It's efficient and can detect cycles of any length, including self-loops.
"""

"""
Advantages of Kahn's algorithm for cycle detection:
1. It can detect cycles of any length, including self-loops.
2. It's efficient, visiting each vertex and edge only once.
3. It provides a clear indication of the presence of a cycle without needing to trace the cycle itself.
4. The algorithm is relatively simple to implement and understand.

Considerations:
1. It modifies the graph structure (in-degrees), which might not be desirable in some cases.
2. It doesn't provide information about the specific vertices involved in the cycle.
3. For graphs without cycles, it effectively performs a topological sort as a side effect.
