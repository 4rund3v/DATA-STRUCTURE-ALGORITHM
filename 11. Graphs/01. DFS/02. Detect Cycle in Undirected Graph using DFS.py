Problem: Detect Cycle in Undirected Graph using DFS

Given an undirected graph, detect if there is a cycle in the graph using Depth-First Search (DFS).

Function Signatures:
    def create_graph(V: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]
    def isCycle(V: int, adj: List[List[int]]) -> bool
    def DFS(adj: List[List[int]], u: int, parent: int, visited: List[bool]) -> bool

Where:
    V: number of vertices
    edges: list of edges, where each edge is represented as [u, v]
    adj: adjacency list representation of the graph

Returns:
     cycle is detected, False otherwise

Constraints:    1 ≤ V, E ≤ 10^4

"""
Explanation:

1. The DFS function has been corrected to properly detect cycles:
   - It marks the current vertex as visited at the beginning.
   - For each adjacent vertex v:
     - If v is the parent, we skip it to avoid false positives.
     - If v is already visited (and not the parent), we've found a cycle.
     - If v is not visited, we recursively call DFS on v.
   - It returns True if a cycle is found, False otherwise.

2. The isCycle function remains the same as in your provided code:
   - It initializes the visited array.
   - It calls DFS for each unvisited vertex.
   - It returns True if DFS detects a cycle in any component, False otherwise.

Key points of the cycle detection algorithm:
- We use DFS to traverse the graph.
- We keep track of the parent vertex to avoid false positives.
- A cycle is detected if we encounter an already visited vertex that is not the parent.

Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
Space Complexity: O(V) for the visited array and the recursion stack.

This implementation correctly detects cycles in undirected graphs using DFS,
maintaining a structure similar to what you provided while fixing the logical errors.

"""
own comments 
1. here for cycle detection we need to keep track of who is parent in an un directed graph as 0 -> 1 and 1-> is also a posibility
2. There can we did joint graphs so we need to add a loop to go through all the elements of the graphs before calling BFS or DFS
