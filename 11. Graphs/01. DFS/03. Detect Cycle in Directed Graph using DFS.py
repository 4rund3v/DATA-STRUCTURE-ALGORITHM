Problem: Detect Cycle in Directed Graph using DFS

Given a directed graph, detect if there is a cycle in the graph using Depth-First Search (DFS).

Function Signatures:
    def create_graph(V: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]
    def isCycle(V: int, adj: List[List[int]]) -> bool
    def DFS(adj: List[List[int]], u: int, visited: List[bool], in_recursion: List[bool]) -> bool

Where:
    V: number of vertices
    edges: list of edges, where each edge is represented as [u, v]
    adj: adjacency list representation of the graph

Returns:
    True if a cycle is detected, False otherwise

Constraints:    1 ≤ V, E ≤ 10^4

Explanation:

1. The create_graph function has been modified:
   - It only adds edges in one direction since it's a directed graph.

2. The DFS function has been updated to detect cycles in a directed graph:
   - It uses both visited and in_recursion (recursion stack) arrays.
   - It marks the current vertex as visited and adds it to the recursion stack.
   - For each adjacent vertex v:
     - If v is not visited, we recursively call DFS on v.
     - If v is already in the recursion stack, we've found a cycle.
   - After exploring all adjacent vertices, we remove the current vertex from the recursion stack.

3. The isCycle function has been slightly modified:
   - It initializes both visited and in_recursion arrays.
   - It calls DFS for each unvisited vertex.
   - It returns True if DFS detects a cycle in any component, False otherwise.

Key points of the cycle detection algorithm for directed graphs:
- We use DFS to traverse the graph.
- We keep track of vertices in the current recursion stack.
- A cycle is detected if we encounter a vertex that is already in the recursion stack.

Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
Space Complexity: O(V) for the visited array, recursion stack array, and the recursion call stack.

This implementation correctly detects cycles in directed graphs using DFS,
maintaining a structure similar to the undirected graph solution while adapting it for directed graphs.

"""
Key differences from undirected graph cycle detection:
    1. In directed graphs, we don't need to keep track of the parent vertex.
    2. We use an additional array (in_recursion) to keep track of vertices in the current DFS path.
    3. A cycle is detected when we encounter a vertex that is already in the recursion stack, not just visited.
