"""
Problem Statement:
There are n computers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by ethernet cables connections forming a network where 
connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between computers ai and bi. Any computer can reach any other 
computer directly or indirectly through the network.

You are given an initial computer network connections. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected 
computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.

Return the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected. 
If it is not possible, return -1.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= connections.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 10^5)
connections[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < n
ai != bi
There are no repeated connections.
No two computers are connected by more than one cable.

Time Complexity: O(N + M), where N is the number of computers and M is the number of connections.
Space Complexity: O(N) for the parent and rank arrays.
