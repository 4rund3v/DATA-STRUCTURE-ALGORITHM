Problem Statement:
Given a binary tree root, return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to the recursive call stack).

Detailed Explanation:
We use a bottom-up approach to solve this problem efficiently:
1. We perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree, starting from the leaf nodes and moving up to the root.
2. For each node, we determine if its subtree is a valid BST and calculate its sum.
3. We propagate information upwards: for each subtree, we return the minimum value, maximum value, and sum.
4. At each node, we check if it forms a valid BST with its left and right subtrees.
5. If a subtree is a valid BST, we update the global maximum sum if necessary.
6. This approach allows us to check BST validity and calculate sums in a single pass through the tree.

Key Idea: By returning min and max values from subtrees, we can efficiently check BST validity at each node.


Examples:
1. Input: root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]
   Output: 20
   Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid BST is obtained in root node with key equal to 3.
   Tree structure:

     / \   / \
    2   4 2   5
           \   \
            4   6

2. Input: root = [4,3,null,1,2]
   Output: 2
   Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid BST is obtained in a single root node with key equal to 2.
   Tree structure:

3. Input: root = [-4,-2,-5]
   Output: 0
   Explanation: All values are negative. Return an empty BST.
