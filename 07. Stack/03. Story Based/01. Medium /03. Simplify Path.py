Problem Statement:
Given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, simplify it to its canonical form.
The path begins with '/' and may contain '.', '..', and alphanumeric characters.

Rules:
1. A single period '.' represents the current directory.
2. A double period '..' represents the parent directory.
3. Multiple consecutive slashes '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
4. Any other period sequences (e.g. '...') are treated as file/directory names.

The simplified canonical path should:
- Start with a single slash '/'.
- Have no trailing slash '/' (except for the root directory).
- Have no '.' or '..' components.
- Have only single slashes between directory names.

Examples:
Input: "/home/" => Output: "/home"
Input: "/home//foo/" => Output: "/home/foo"
Input: "/a/./b/../../c/" => Output: "/c"
Input: "/../" => Output: "/"
Input: "/home/../../.." => Output: "/"
Input: "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures" => Output: "/home/user/Pictures"
Input: "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./" => Output: "/.../b/d"
"""

class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        
        path = path.split("/")
        output = []

        for i in range(len(path)):
            if path[i] == "" or path[i] == ".":
                # Ignore empty components and current directory
                continue
            elif path[i] == "..":
                # Go up one directory if possible
                if output:
                    output.pop()
            else:
                # Add valid directory or file name to the output
                output.append(path[i])
        
        path = "/".join(output)
        return "/" + path

"""
Analysis:

1. Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input path
   - Splitting the path: O(n)
   - Iterating through the components: O(n)
   - Joining the output: O(n)

2. Space Complexity: O(n)
   - The 'output' list can store up to n components in the worst case
   - Additional space for the split operation: O(n)

3. Comparison with the previous solution:
   - This solution uses a class structure, which is common in leetcode-style problems
   - It uses an 'output' list instead of a 'stack', but the functionality is the same
   - The logic for processing path components is identical
   - This solution doesn't handle the case where the path ends with '/' explicitly, 
     but it works correctly due to the splitting and joining operations

4. Potential improvements:
   - Could use more descriptive variable names (e.g., 'components' instead of 'path' after splitting)
   - Could add type hints for the 'output' list
   - Could add example usage and test cases within the class or as separate methods

Overall, this is a clean and efficient solution to the problem.
