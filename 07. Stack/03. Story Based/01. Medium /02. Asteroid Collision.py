"""
Problem Statement:

    We are given an array 'asteroids' of integers representing asteroids in a row.
    For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction 
    (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

    Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one 
    will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same 
    direction will never meet.

Constraints:
    * 2 <= asteroids.length <= 10^4
    * -1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000
    * asteroids[i] != 0

"""
Time Complexity: O(n)
- We iterate through each asteroid once in the outer loop: O(n)
- Each asteroid can be pushed and popped from the stack at most once: O(n)
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
- In the worst case, when no collisions occur, we might store all asteroids in the stack
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(n)

where n is the number of asteroids in the input list.
