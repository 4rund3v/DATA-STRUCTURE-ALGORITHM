Problem: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

    Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
    A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them.
    A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. The path does not need to pass through the root.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to the recursive call stack).

Approach:
    1. We use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree.
    2. For each node, we calculate:
        a) The maximum path sum that goes through the node and one of its subtrees.
        b) The maximum path sum that goes through the node and both of its subtrees.
    3. We update our global maximum path sum at each node.
    4. We return the maximum path sum that goes through the node and one of its subtrees,
       which allows the parent nodes to potentially use this path.

Examples:

1. Input: root = [1,2,3]
   Output: 6
   Tree structure:
     1
    / \
   2   3

2. Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
   Output: 42
   Tree structure:
     -10
     / \
    9  20
      /  \
     15   7
