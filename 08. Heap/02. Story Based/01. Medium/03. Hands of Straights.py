Problem Statement:
    Given an array of integers and a positive integer k, determine if it's possible to divide 
    the array into sets of k consecutive numbers. 
    This problem is also known as "Hand of Straights" where the array represents card values and k is the group size.

    For "Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers":
    - Input: An array of integers 'nums' and an integer 'k'
    - Output: True if the array can be divided into sets of k consecutive numbers, False otherwise

    For "Hand of Straights":
    - Input: An array 'hand' representing card values and an integer 'groupSize'
    - Output: True if the cards can be rearranged into groups of 'groupSize' consecutive cards, False otherwise

Approach:
    We use a combination of a hash map (Counter) to count occurrences of each number
    and a min heap to process numbers in ascending order. We check if we can form
    groups of k consecutive numbers starting from the smallest available number.

Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array
    - Counting elements: O(n)
    - Heapify: O(n)
    - Main loop: O(n log n) due to heap operations

Space Complexity: O(n)
    - Counter: O(n)
    - Heap: O(n)
