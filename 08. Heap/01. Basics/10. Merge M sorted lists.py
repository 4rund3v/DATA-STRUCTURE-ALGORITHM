Problem Statement:
    Given an array of k sorted lists, merge them into a single sorted list.

Example:
    Input: [
        [1, 4, 5],
        [1, 3, 4],
        [2, 6]
    ]
    Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]

Algorithm Steps:
    1. Create a min-heap to keep track of the smallest elements from each list.
    2. Initialize the heap by adding the first element from each list. Each entry in the heap is a tuple containing:
        - The value of the element
        - The index of the list it came from
        - The index of the element within its list
    3. Enter a loop that continues until the heap is empty:
        - Pop the smallest element from the heap
        - Add this element to our result list
        - If there are more elements in the list that this element came from, add the next element from that list to the heap
    4. Once the heap is empty, we've processed all elements, and our result list contains all elements in sorted order.

Time Complexity: O(N log k)
    - N is the total number of elements across all lists
    - k is the number of lists
    - Each element is pushed and popped from the heap once, and the heap has at most k elements at any time

Space Complexity: O(k) + O(N)
    - O(k) for the heap
    - O(N) for the output list
