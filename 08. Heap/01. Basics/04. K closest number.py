Problem Statement:
    list of numbers, a target number, and an integer k, find the k closest numbers to the target in the list.

Time Complexity: O(n log k), where n is the number of elements in the input list.
    - We iterate through all n elements once.
    - For each element, we might perform a heap operation, which takes log k time.

Space Complexity: O(k)
    - We maintain a heap of at most k elements.

Algorithm:
    1. Iterate through the list once, keeping track of the k closest numbers seen so far.
    2. For each number, if we haven't found k numbers yet, we add it to the heap.
    3. If we've already found k numbers, we compare the current number to the furthest number in our heap. 
    If it's closer, we remove the furthest and add the current number.
    4. Finally, we sort the k closest numbers based on their actual values.
