"""
Problem Statement:
    Given an array of integers and two numbers k1 and k2, find the sum of all elements between the k1'th smallest and k2'th smallest elements of the array (k1 < k2).

Example:
For the array [20, 8, 22, 4, 12, 10, 14] with k1 = 3 and k2 = 6:
    The 3rd smallest element (k1) is 10
    The 6th smallest element (k2) is 20
    The elements between 10 and 20 are 12 and 14
    So the sum is 12 + 14 = 26

Time Complexity: O(n log k2)
    - find_kth_smallest function is called twice: O(n log k1 + n log k2)
    - Final summation step: O(n)
    - Overall: O(n log k2) since k2 > k1

Space Complexity: O(k2)
    - find_kth_smallest function uses a heap of size k
    - The larger heap will be for k2, so the space complexity is O(k2)
