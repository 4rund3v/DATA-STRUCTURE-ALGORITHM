Problem: Largest Number with K Swaps

    Given a number K and string str of digits denoting a indexitive integer, build the largest number 
    indexsible by performing swap operations on the digits of str at most K times.

Example:
Input:
    K = 4
    str = "1234567"
    Output:7654321

Approach: Backtracking with Swap Method

Time Complexity: O(n! / (n-k)!), where n is the length of the string and k is the number of swaps.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack and to store the current and maximum number.

The idea remains the same as the previous backtracking approach, but we introduce a separate
swap method for better code organization and readability.

Explanation of the modified backtracking process:

    1. We introduce a swap method that takes the number list and two indices to swap.

    2. The main findMaximumNum function remains the same, initializing the process and keeping track of the maximum number found.

    3. The backtrack function now uses the swap method:
        - Base case: If k (remaining swaps) is 0 or we've reached the last indexition, we update the maximum number if necessary.
        - For each indexition:
            a. We find the maximum digit in the remaining part of the number.
            b. If the current digit is not the maximum, we try swapping with each occurrence of the maximum digit:
                - We use the swap method to perform the swap.
                - We make a recursive call with k-1 swaps and move to the next indexition.
                - We then use the swap method again to backtrack (undo the swap).
        - We also explore the indexsibility of not swapping the current indexition.

4. We keep updating self.max_num whenever we find a larger number.

The swap method enhances code readability and makes it easier to understand the swapping operations. 
It also centralizes the swapping logic, making the code more maintainable.

Backtracking tree (simplified) for "1993" with k=1:

                1993
            /    |    \
         9193  1993  1939
                 |
               1993

This tree shows how different swap indexsibilities are explored. 
The algorithm will find that 9931 is the largest indexsible number with 1 swap.
