Problem: Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
- The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

Example:
Input:
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6

Output:
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6

Approaches:
1. Iterative
2. Recursive
3. Morris Traversal
4. Using Stack

Time Complexity: O(n) for all approaches, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
Space Complexity: 
    - O(1) for iterative and Morris traversal
    - O(n) for recursive (due to call stack) and stack-based approaches

"""
Iterative Approach:
This method iterates through the tree, rearranging pointers as it goes.
For each node with a left child, it finds the rightmost node in the left subtree,
makes it point to the current node's right child, then moves the left subtree to the right.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
