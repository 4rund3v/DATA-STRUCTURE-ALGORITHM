Problem Statement:
This algorithm solves two related problems:

1. Find a Peak Element in an Array:
   A peak element in an array is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Given an integer array arr, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

   You may imagine that arr[-1] = arr[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

2. Find Maximum Element in a Bitonic Array:
   A Bitonic array is an array that is first strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing. Note that a peak element in a Bitonic array is also its maximum element.

The algorithm below efficiently solves both these problems using the same approach.

Algorithm (Binary Search):
    1. Handle edge cases:
    - If array has only one element, return 0
    - If first element is greater than second, return 0
    - If last element is greater than second-last, return n-1
    2. Initialize low = 1 and high = n-2
    3. While low <= high:
    a. Calculate mid = (low + high) // 2
    b. If arr[mid] is greater than both its neighbors, return mid
    c. If arr[mid] > arr[mid-1], we are in the ascending part, so move right: low = mid + 1
    d. Otherwise, move left: high = mid - 1
    4. If no peak is found, return -1 (this should never happen given the problem constraints)

Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the length of the array
Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space

Note: 
- For the Peak Element problem, this algorithm finds any peak element, not necessarily the global maximum.
- For the Bitonic Array problem, this algorithm finds the maximum element, which is the unique peak in the array.
