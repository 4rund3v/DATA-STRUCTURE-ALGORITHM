Problem Statement:
Implement a Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure that supports the following operations:
1. Initialize the Trie object.
2. Insert a word into the Trie.
3. Search for a word in the Trie.
4. Check if any word in the Trie starts with a given prefix.

Space Complexity:
- O(N * M), where N is the number of words inserted, and M is the average length of the words.
- In the worst case, when there are no common prefixes, the space complexity can be O(N * M).
- Each node in the Trie contains a dictionary of children and a boolean flag, which takes constant space.

Time Complexity:
- Insert: O(M), where M is the length of the word being inserted.
- Search: O(M), where M is the length of the word being searched.
- StartsWith: O(M), where M is the length of the prefix.

Explanation:
1. The Trie is implemented using a tree-like structure where each node represents a character.
2. Each TrieNode contains a dictionary 'children' to store its child nodes and a boolean 'is_end_of_word' to mark the end of a word.
3. The Trie class has a root node initialized in the constructor.
4. The insert method adds a word to the Trie by creating new nodes for each character if they don't exist.
5. The search method checks if a word exists in the Trie by traversing the nodes and checking if the last node is marked as the end of a word.
6. The startsWith method checks if any word in the Trie starts with the given prefix by traversing the nodes for the prefix characters.

Examples:
1. Inserting "apple":
   - Create nodes for 'a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e'
   - Mark the last 'e' node as the end of a word

2. Searching for "app":
   - Traverse nodes for 'a', 'p', 'p'
   - Return False because the last 'p' node is not marked as the end of a word

3. Checking startsWith "app":
   - Traverse nodes for 'a', 'p', 'p'
   - Return True because all prefix characters exist in the Trie
