"""
Reverses a singly linked list.

Solution Steps:
    1. Initialize three pointers: prev as None, current as head, and next as None.
    2. Traverse the list:
        - Store the next node.
        - Reverse the current node's pointer.
        - Move prev and current one step forward.
    3. Return prev as the new head of the reversed list.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Examples:
1. Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
    Output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL

2. Input: 1 -> 2 -> NULL
    Output: 2 -> 1 -> NULL

3. Input: NULL
    Output: NULL

        Solution Explanation:
            1. Base case: If the list is empty or has only one node, return the head as is.
            2. Recursive case:
            a. Recursively call reverseList on the rest of the list (head.next).
            b. Set the next node's 'next' pointer to the current node.
            c. Set the current node's 'next' pointer to None to avoid cycles.
            3. Return the new head (which will be the last node of the original list).
