"""
Very complicated problem of designing a logic for a logger. 
I was successfully able to provide a solution using sliding window approach
but for the follow up question my approach didn't work. 
I had to come up with an entirely new algorithm, and hence took me sometime to figure out 
and rewrite all the code. The solution was correct (I think!) but was not able to code it fully.
The interviewer looked satisfied though.
