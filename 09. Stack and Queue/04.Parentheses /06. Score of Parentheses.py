Problem: Score of Parentheses

Given a balanced parentheses string s, return the score of the string.

The score of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:
    * "()" has score 1.
    * AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
    * (A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.

Example 1:
    Input: s = "()"
    Output: 1

Example 2:
    Input: s = "(())"
    Output: 2

Example 3:
    Input: s = "()()"
    Output: 2

Constraints:
    * 2 <= s.length <= 50
    * s consists of only '(' and ')'.
    * s is a balanced parentheses string.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where we might need to store all opening parentheses in the stack.

Explanation of the solution:

1. We use a stack to keep track of the scores at different levels of nesting.

2. We iterate through the string:
   - When we encounter an opening parenthesis '(', we push a 0 onto the stack to represent a new level of nesting.
   - When we encounter a closing parenthesis ')', we pop the top score from the stack:
     * If the popped score is 0, it means we've encountered a "()" pair, so we add 1 to the score of the current level.
     * If the popped score is non-zero, it means we're closing a nested structure, so we double the score and add it to the current level.

3. At the end, the score at the base of the stack (stack[0]) is our final result.

Why this works:
- The stack helps us manage nested structures efficiently.
- We're effectively building the score from the innermost parentheses outward.
- The doubling of scores when we close a nested structure (2 * score) handles the "(A)" rule.
- Adding scores at the same level handles the "AB" rule.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we process each character once.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where we might need to store all opening parentheses in the stack (e.g., for a string like "((((....))))").

The test cases cover various scenarios:
1. Simple case: "()"
2. Nested case: "(())"
3. Adjacent case: "()()"
4. Complex nested case: "(()(()))"
5. Mixed nested and adjacent case: "(()())()"

Each test case demonstrates how the function correctly calculates the score based on the rules provided.

This solution efficiently handles all the rules for scoring:
- It gives a score of 1 for "()" by adding 1 when we close an empty pair.
- It handles "AB" by adding scores at the same nesting level.
- It handles "(A)" by doubling the score when we close a non-empty nested structure.
