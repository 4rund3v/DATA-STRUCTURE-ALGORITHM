Problem Statement: Remove K Digits

Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.

Example 1:
    Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
    Output: "1219"
    Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

Example 2:
    Input: num = "10200", k = 1
    Output: "200"
    Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.

Example 3:
    Input: num = "10", k = 2
    Output: "0"
    Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

Constraints:
    * 1 <= k <= num.length <= 10^5
    * num consists of only digits.
    * num does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

Answer Explanation:
The solution uses a greedy approach with a string acting as a stack:
    1. We iterate through each digit in the input number.
    2. For each digit, we compare it with the last digit in our result:
        - If the current digit is smaller and we still have removals left (k > 0),
          we remove digits from the end of our result until we find a smaller digit or run out of removals.
    3. We add the current digit to our result if it's not a leading zero.
    4. After processing all digits, if we still have removals left, we remove them from the end.
    5. If our result is empty, we return "0".

This approach ensures that we keep the smallest possible number by always removing larger digits when possible.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string num.
    - We iterate through each digit once, and each digit is added and removed at most once.

Space Complexity: O(n)
    - In the worst case, we might need to store all digits in our result string.
