On the odessy of mastering the basics of problem solving and intuition building for solving problems in a interview perspective.


### Data Structures and Algorithms
Materials for the DS and Algo preperations

#### Reading materials to refer for basics
  1. [Hello Interview](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code)
    - Contains the basic patterns and some examples for their problems.
    - Level too basic, to get started, if no idea.
  2. [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)
    - Contains reading materials for each type of problem category.
    - Along with docs, contains the problems with increasing level of difficulty
    - mostly problems from leetcode 150
  3. [Educative - Grokking the Coding Interview Patterns in Python](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-in-python)
    - Contains the patterns and their intuition for the solvign problems
    - almost 100 problems a few from the Leetcode 150 and some generic problems. 
  4. Book: A common sense guide to Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Contains a little indepth explanations of the ds and algos and their usecases.
#### Online sources for problem solving & reference
  Ordered based on Quality, relevance, hardness ( hard to comparitively less hard)
  1. [Alphabet 150](https://alphabet150.com/)
    - Contains the alphabet/google related problems
    - Solving all of these should be a good test.
