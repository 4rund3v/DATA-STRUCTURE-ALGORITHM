Problem Statement: Minimum Days to Make m Bouquets
                  * similar to the Koko Eating Bananas problem    
    
    You are given an integer array bloomDay, an integer m and an integer k.
    You want to make m bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use k adjacent flowers from the garden.
    The garden consists of n flowers, the ith flower will bloom in the bloomDay[i] and then can be used in exactly one bouquet.
    
    Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make m bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make m bouquets return -1.

Example 1:
    Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1
    Output: 3

Example 2:
    Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
    Output: -1

Example 3:
    Input: bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3
    Output: 12

Constraints:
    * bloomDay.length == n
    * 1 <= n <= 10^5
    * 1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 10^9
    * 1 <= m <= 10^6
    * 1 <= k <= n

Solution Explanation:
    The solution uses a binary search approach to find the minimum number of days:

    1. We define a helper function 'get_num_of_bouquets' that checks how many bouquets can be made by a given day.
    2. In the main function 'min_days', we perform a binary search on the possible days:
        - The minimum possible day is the minimum bloom day.
        - The maximum possible day is the maximum bloom day.
    3. We keep narrowing down our search range until we find the minimum day that allows making m bouquets.

Time Complexity: O(n * log(max(bloomDay))), where n is the length of the bloomDay array.
    - The binary search takes O(log(max(bloomDay))) iterations.
    - In each iteration, we call the 'get_num_of_bouquets' function which takes O(n) time.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
