Problem Statement: Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold
    * similar to the Koko Eating Bananas problem
    
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer threshold, we will choose a positive integer divisor, 
    divide all the array by it, and sum the division's result. Find the smallest divisor such that the 
    result mentioned above is less than or equal to threshold.

    Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. 
    (For example: 7/3 = 3 and 10/2 = 5).

    The test cases are generated so that there will be an answer.

Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6
    Output: 5
    Explanation: We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1. 
    If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum of 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5 the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2). 

Example 2:
    Input: nums = [44,22,33,11,1], threshold = 5
    Output: 44

Constraints:
    * 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
    * 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
    * nums.length <= threshold <= 10^6

Solution Explanation:
    The solution uses a binary search approach to find the smallest divisor:

    1. We define a helper function 'calculate_sum' that calculates the sum of divisions rounded up for a given divisor.
    2. In the main function 'smallestDivisor', we perform a binary search on the possible divisors:
        - The minimum possible divisor is 1.
        - The maximum possible divisor is the maximum number in the input array.
    3. We keep narrowing down our search range until we find the smallest divisor that makes the sum less than or equal to the threshold.

Time Complexity: O(n * log(max(nums))), where n is the length of the nums array.
    - The binary search takes O(log(max(nums))) iterations.
    - In each iteration, we call the 'calculate_sum' function which takes O(n) time.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
